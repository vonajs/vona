# ORM Basics

Let's first introduce the basic concepts of Vona ORM:

1. `Entity`: Defines the basic fields of an entity
2. `Model`: Defines the relationships between entities and provides methods and tools for operating the database. The methods provided by the `Model` can automatically infer the required type structure based on the relationships of entities
3. `Migration and Changes`: Used for database schema changes and data initialization

These basic ORM concepts were explained in the introduction to the `API`. See:

- [API: Entity](../../essentials/api/entity.md)
- [API: Model](../../essentials/api/model.md)
- [API: Dto](../../essentials/api/dto.md)
- [API: Migration and Changes](../../essentials/api/version.md)
