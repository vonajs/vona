# BeanBase

`BeanBase` is the base class for all beans. By inheriting from `BeanBase`, we can easily access commonly used tools and capabilities when writing code

## Why is Vona's IOC container code more concise?

The reason is to prioritize the use of the `dependency lookup` strategy, resulting in fewer decorator functions and fewer type annotations. Injecting system capability objects into `BeanBase` is one of the mechanisms for implementing `dependency lookup` strategies
