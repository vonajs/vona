# Broadcast

Broadcasts can be emitted to multiple worker processes in the system, allowing each worker process to execute business logic

## Create Broadcast

For example, create a broadcast `echo` in the module `demo-student`, so that each worker process outputs `Hello world` to the console

### 1. Cli Command

``` bash
$ vona :create:bean broadcast echo --module=demo-student
```

### 2. Menu Command

Context Menu - [Module Path]: `Vona Bean/Broadcast`

## Broadcast Definition

``` typescript
export interface TypeBroadcastEchoJobData { message: string }

@Broadcast()
export class BroadcastEcho
  extends BeanBroadcastBase<TypeBroadcastEchoJobData>
  implements IBroadcastExecute<TypeBroadcastEchoJobData> {
  async execute(data: TypeBroadcastEchoJobData, isEmitter?: boolean) {
    if (!isEmitter) {
      console.log(`pid: ${process.pid} message: ${data.message}`);
    }
  }
}
```

- `TypeBroadcastEchoJobData`: Defines broadcast data
- `execute`: Outputs the message to the console

* execute parameters

|Name|Description|
|--|--|
|data|Broadcast data|
|isEmitter|Whether it is the worker process emiting the broadcast|

## Emit Broadcast

``` typescript
class ControllerStudent {
  test() {
    const data = { message: 'Hello world' };
    console.log(`pid: ${process.pid} message: ${data.message}`);
    this.scope.broadcast.echo.emit(data);
  }
}  
```

- `this.scope.broadcast.echo`: Retrieves the broadcast instance through the module scope
- `emit`: Emits the broadcast, passing in the broadcast data

::: tip
If business logic has already been executed in the current worker process, you can check `isEmitter` in the `execute` method to ignore the worker process that emit the broadcast
:::

## Broadcast Parameters

Parameters can be configured for broadcasts

``` typescript
@Broadcast({
  instance: true,
  transaction: true,
})
class BroadcastEcho {}
```

|Name|Description|
|--|--|
|instance|Whether to ensure that the instance has been initialized. Defaults to `true`|
|transaction|Whether to enable database transaction|

- `instance`: VonaJS supports `multi-instance/multi-tenancy`. If the broadcast's business logic requires manipulating instance data, then you need to ensure that the instance has been initialized
- `transaction`: If set to true, the system will automatically put the broadcast's `execute` method into a database transaction

## App Config

Broadcast parameters can be configured in App Config

`src/backend/config/config/config.ts`

``` typescript
// onions
config.onions = {
  broadcast: {
    'demo-student:echo': {
      instance: true,
      transaction: true,
    },
  },
};
```

## Inspect

You can directly inspect the currently effective broadcast list

``` diff
class ControllerStudent {
  @Web.get('test')
  test() {
+   this.bean.onion.broadcast.inspect();
  }
}
```

- `this.bean.onion`: Get the global Service instance `onion`
- `.broadcast`: Get the Service instance related to the broadcast
- `.inspect`: Output the currently effective broadcast list

When accessing the `test` API, the currently effective broadcast list will be automatically output to the console, as shown below:
