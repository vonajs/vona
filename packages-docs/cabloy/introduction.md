# CabloyJS

## The relationship between VonaJS and CabloyJS

VonaJS, as the underlying framework, provides a collection of modules that enable a closed-loop capability. This means you can develop a complete project based on VonaJS

To further enhance the development experience and efficiency, CabloyJS provides a more advanced collection of modules

## Development History

### 1. 2016: V1-V4

Development of CabloyJS began in 2016. CabloyJS is a full-stack NodeJS framework based on JavaScript, and has evolved through major versions, including V1, V2, V3, and V4

- Some say: `CabloyJS is like a textbook`
- Others say: `If CabloyJS supported TypeScript and had a decoupled frontend and backend architecture, it would be even better`

### 2. 2023: V5 Development

In 2023, after thorough evaluation and verification, CabloyJS V5 will undergo a complete redesign, adopting a completely new architectural philosophy. Developed in TypeScript and utilizing a frontend/backend separation, it has spawned two new underlying frameworks:

- `ZovaJS`: A more intuitive framework with the pros of Vue3, React and Angular, empowers developers to build elegant, fast and reliable applications
- `VonaJS`: An intuitive, elegant and powerful Node.js web framework for rapidly developing enterprise applications of any size. It pioneers dynamic DTO inference and generation capabilities, significantly improving development efficiency and experience

### 3. 2025: V5 Release

In 2025, ZovaJS V5 and VonaJS V5 have been released. CabloyJS V5, building on the new underlying framework, continues to provide more advanced capabilities to further enhance the development experience and efficiency, fulfilling its vision and mission of being a `textbook framework`
