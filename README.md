## Philosophy

### 1. About Coding

Many frameworks use the simplest use cases to demonstrate design elegance, ignoring the coding challenges presented by business complexity. As business grows and changes, project code quickly degrades and becomes difficult to maintain. Vona, however, addresses the complexity of large-scale businesses and proposes a series of engineering solutions. This allows us to maintain elegant and intuitive code even when developing large-scale business systems, improving development efficiency and experience while facilitating subsequent code iteration and maintenance

### 2. About Performance

Many frameworks use the simplest use cases to demonstrate high performance, ignoring the performance challenges presented by business complexity. As business grows and changes, project performance plummets, and various optimization and mitigation measures lead to cumbersome and lengthy code. Vona, however, addresses the complexity of large-scale businesses and incorporates caching strategies into the framework's core, implementing mechanisms such as `two-layer cache`, `query cache`, and `entity cache`. This makes it easy to develop large-scale business systems, ensuring that code remains elegant and intuitive
